# Vocabularies Publication Profile
This is a *profile* of the [Simple Knowledge Organization System (SKOS)](https://www.w3.org/TR/skos-reference/) intended to allow for easy to manage and publish vocabularies.

By *profile*, what is meant here is "A specification that constrains, extends, combines, or provides guidance or explanation about the usage of other specifications." (from [PROF](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/#definitions)) and, here the *other specification* is SKOS.

This profile is formulated according to the [Profiles Vocabulary](https://www.w3.org/TR/dx-prof/) and provides [Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL)](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) validator files that can be used to determine whether vocabularies conform to this profile.

This profile is hosted online in [Linked Data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data) form using a persistent web address:
